This project is based on the React Framework. 

We also use other tools like react routers, Firebase and authentication.

This project can run on windows OS/Mac OS

We are going to add more features to support mobile devices.

### `Already Implemented functionalities`

1.  Some beautiful and cool e-commercial store pages: Based on React Framework, I have to say they are so cooooool!.
2.  Users Sign-in and Sign-out, based on google FireBase, clients can simply login with their google accounts.
3.  Store data in a NoSQL database. We just try that kind of database, it seems not bad.
4.  Cart Items functionality. Never heard any e-commercial web page or applications exist without a cart functionality.
