##  Our First E-commercial Web Application

In the project, we build an e-commerce web application with beautiful UI

### `Quick Start`

You can simply run this web app by npm start.

### `Based on React`

This project is based on the React Framework. 

We also use other react-related tools including:

Redux, Router, etc...

### `Environment`

This project can run on windows OS/Mac OS

We are going to add more features to support mobile devices.

### `Already Implemented functionalities`

1.  Some beautiful and cool e-commercial store pages: Based on React Framework, I have to say they are so cooooool!.

2.  Users Sign-in and Sign-out, based on google FireBase, clients can simply login with their google accounts.

3.  Store data in a NoSQL database, more specifically, GraphQL. We just try that kind of database, it seems not bad.

4.  Cart Items functionality. Never heard any e-commercial web page or applications exist without a cart functionality.

    

### `What expected functionalities in future`

1.  It will be linked to papal or other online-payment API to enable clients really pay...(to our accounts...)
2.  More safe and stable authentication by cloud services.
3.  Mobile devices support
4.  Bundle it by webpack
